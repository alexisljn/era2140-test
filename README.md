# Web3 Technical test

This project is a technical test for a job offer for a French web3 venture studio.

I had to write a frontend, a backend and a smart contract to create kind of
a trivia game where user can mint their score at the end of the quiz.

They have to get a JWT token to send their answers to the server and to mint
their NFT they have to send a merkle proof to contract which will check if
proof matches the merkle root stored on chain.

## Technical stack

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js
- Smart contract: Solidity
